# InterLink Database Schemas

This project contains the schemas for all releases of the [InterLink](https://www.github.com/southwinds-io/interlink) database.

## Deploying the database

To deploy the database [DbMan CLI](https://github.com/southwinds-io/dbman.git) has to be accessible as a command.

To get a postgres container up and running with the schemas deploy:

```bash
$ sh run.sh
```
